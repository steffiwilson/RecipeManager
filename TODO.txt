-Steffi presentation notes: 
Learned working in a team:
	Benefits of function calls ("magic" is good)
	Better to have documentation earlier (confusion on data types in the database)
	Good to have a balance of strengths and specialization on the team
	Don't have to be together to code, as long as you have some sort of a plan of who is doing what and are communicating 

From the class re: project - 
	+benefits of documentation for getting a good perspective on all the layers of complexity
	+beneficial to have documentation of the workflows for how the program is used (use case and activity)
	-need to apply better time management
		-- used an "agile" methodology (good for but had a long period where we were not making progress

Overall experience:
	learned to appreciate the benefits of other technologies more
	learned I've absorbed a lot more about programming than I knew
	learned there's a lot of cool tools for making your diagrams
